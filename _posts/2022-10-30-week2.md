NOTE: I mistakenly believed the GitHub blog was not working and thus did not submit the blog posts I have made thus far. (Week 2-9)

This week, I learned about the usage of HTML elements, as well as some basic knowledge on CSS, such as how to alter the colours of elements and the different styles of CSS, namely in-line, internal, and external CSS.
