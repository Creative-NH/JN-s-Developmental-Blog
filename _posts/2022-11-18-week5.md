NOTE: I mistakenly believed the GitHub blog was not working and thus did not submit the blog posts I have made thus far. (Week 2-9)

The contents of this week’s lesson were by far the most informative and engaging, providing a thorough introduction to JavaScript. The lesson explained how to utilise Java variables, objects and arrays in a clear, concise manner. Besides that, I was also given an in-depth overview of the Document Object Model (DOM), a map of the elements in a HTML document. This, coupled with JavaScript, grants users greater control over their webpages, enabling them to manipulate their elements and thus paving the way for greater site interactivity.
